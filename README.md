# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : as per the following import num py to generate the inverse of the matrix
### Step 2: import the generated input with array to define the np
### Step 3: simplify using null variable with defined class to genereate inverse of matrix
### Step 4: thus that the inverse of the matrix can be obtained by using the above sequential statements.

## Program:
~~~
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
b=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(b)
~~~
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
